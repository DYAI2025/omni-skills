# Scoring-Frameworks (WSJF & RICE)

## WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)

- Felder: BV, TC, RR, JS
- CoD = BV + TC + RR; WSJF = CoD / JS
- Skalen: 1–10; JS > 0

## RICE

- Felder: Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort
- RICE = (Reach _ Impact _ Confidence) / Effort
- Impact ∈ {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3}; Confidence ∈ [0,1]; Effort > 0
